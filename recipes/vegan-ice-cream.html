    <p><em>vegan mint chip ice cream</em></p>
    <p>This mint ice cream is the real thing, made with an abundance of fresh mint leaves for a flavor that's grassy and bright. Mint plus coconut milk are a perfect match.</p>
    <p><em> You won't notice the difference!</em></p>

    <h2>. ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One 13.5-ounce can (about 1 3/4 cup) coconut milk</li>
        <li>One 14-ounce can (about 1 3/4 cup) coconut cream (see note)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup "light" (clear) corn syrup</li>
        <li>3/4 cup raw (turbinado) sugar (see note)</li>
        <li>1 large bunch fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>3/4 to 1 tsp kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces dark chocolate, finely chopped and chilled in freezer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>. method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan combine coconut milk, coconut cream, corn syrup, and sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from heat, stir in mint leaves, cover, and let steep for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Strain mixture into a clean saucepan, pressing on mint leaves with a spoon to press out all coconut milk, and return to a simmer. Transfer mixture to blender, cover very tightly, and blend for 30 seconds. (Alternately use immersion blender directly in pot.) Pour into an airtight container, then add salt to taste.</li>

Add dark chocolate in final minutes of churning. Transfer to an airtight container and chill in freezer until ice cream is firm enough to scoop, about 5 hours.</li>
